## About

This project was made during a online course, so I decided to improved it, since the code was too basic. I made some upgrades on the base code that made the project look more "elegant", and I really liked the final result. 

## Some stuff and upgrades I did

| Feature                            | Description                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **"Please wait"**     | I added an "please wait" message when the users clicks on the "load more" button, but the page didn't rendered the pokemons yet. |
| **Background**         | Video background to give pokédex vibes :) |
| **Modal window**           | Just added a modal window when you click the Pokémon you want to see more details. I did a lot of details in this window, but you can always improve. |
| **Header**            | I'm a oldschool guy, from back when everything was <div class="x">. I love headers.|
| **Transitions** | Added some transitions effects when you hover the Pokémon to select it, and in the logo located at the header|
| **General visual** | The original project was too "raw", so I tried to put a lot of "details" and trinkets.|

## What else

I may update this project in the future, but feel free to improved it or use it at your will to study (may not be the best example to study, but ok). I would like to add in the future some new features to this project, like more infos about the Pokémons, a searchbar that allow the user to search for a Pokémon by it's number and/or it's name, type, etc. Maybe one day?

## Guide and comments

I will leave this space for my future-self to explain all the improvements that I did in this code, and how you can modify it at your will. But myself-today will leave this message for now. Sorry.
